title: CPSSD Tackles Hashcode 2017
---

Google's [Hashcode][1] qualification round took
place on the 23rd of February, and lots of CPSSD first and second years crowded
in the DCU Hashcode hub to compete.

The Hashcode online round consists of one large optimisation problem tackled
over four hours. This year's problem involved trying to optimally store videos
in caches of a fixed size in order to reduce the latency when large bunches of
videos are requested by specific endpoints. It was more interesting than it
sounds, I swear.

We stalwart students of CPSSD dived in. The team `Three Weeks`
([Brandon Ibbotson][2] and [Lucas Savva][3]) finished with a hearty score of
1,635,420, enough for 1,207th place globally and 17th place in Ireland.
Meanwhile, [Noah Donnelly][4] and [Cian Ruane][5] in team of
`'"><script>alert()</script>` finished with 2,416,068 points, making us the
highest scoring team in Ireland, and coming 164th worldwide.
[Cian wrote some words about how we did it][6].

We had a lot of fun, and I'm very thankful to Gary Conway and the DCU School
of Computing for organising to host a hub in DCU, and providing pizza-based
sustenance to us during the competition. Fingers crossed that next year DCU
returns to cheekily pass out UCC in the final hour.
