[Feedlark](http://feedlark.com) is an RSS aggregator built by Aaron Delaney, Lucas Savva, Cian Ruane, Ross O'sullivan and Noah Donnelly.

Feedlark aims to be efficient, fast, and smart. Users can get updates on RSS or Atom feeds they follow through a slick Material Design interface. They can receive email summaries of their stream, view their stream through a plaintext endpoint (ideal for command line usage!) and bookmark articles for later.

What's more, a user can upvote and downvote articles according to their interests. The system will use basic topic modelling to categorise each article, and analyse what topics each user favours over time. The system will then prioritise articles a user is likely to be interested in based on its topics, saving them time trawling their stream for relevant content.
